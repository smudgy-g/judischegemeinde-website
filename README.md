## Required pages

The website is set up with an about page and a contact page which you will need to set up as pages in the `page`. Afterwards you can create menu links in the `settings` and the links to them. This will enable you to write you own headings and content. You can also add more pages if you wish however the menu bar could potentially get over-crowded so bear that in mind.
